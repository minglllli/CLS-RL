# Think or Not Think: A Study of Explicit Thinking in Rule-Based Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
üóûÔ∏è News

**2025/09/18:** Excited to share that Think or Not Think has been accepted to NeurIPS 2025 as a Spotlight paper! See you in San Diego!

üîç Overview

This paper investigates the role of explicit thinking process in rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). We find several interesting findings of the thinking process of visual RFT.

Key features:
  * **"Free-Lunch" Phenomenon:** Demonstrates that fine-tuning with CLS-RL on one dataset can improve performance on other, distinct datasets.

* **Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT**
  
* **Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL.**
  
* **There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy**


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minglllli/CLS-RL.git
cd CLS-RL
conda create -n cls-rl python=3.11
conda activate cls-rl
bash setup.sh

Change the dataset name in b2n.sh, then run
```bash
bash b2n.sh
```
#### 2. No-Thinking-RL Training
##### Fewshot training
Change the dataset name in fewshot_no-think.sh, then run
```bash
bash fewshot_no-think.sh
```
##### base-eo-new training
