# CLS-RL: Image Classification with Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning
üîç Overview

CLS-RL explores fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for image classification using rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce CLS-RL, which leverages verifiable signals (class names) for fine-tuning. CLS-RL demonstrates a "free-lunch" phenomenon, showing cross-dataset improvement, and we further introduce No-Thinking-CLS-RL, which optimizes performance by removing the thinking process during training.

Key features of CLS-RL:
* **Rule-based Reinforcement Learning:** Fine-tunes MLLMs using verifiable reward losses instead of token-level losses, guiding models to explore diverse reasoning.
* **"Free-Lunch" Phenomenon:** Demonstrates that fine-tuning with CLS-RL on one dataset can improve performance on other, distinct datasets.
* **No-Thinking Variant:** Introduces No-Thinking-CLS-RL, which removes the thinking process during training, leading to improved performance and reduced training time.



The code is coming soon!
